Hello, my name is <u>Gabriel Arruda</u>, but you may know me online as <a href="https://github.com/arrudagba" style="color: #3162d4;">arrudagba</a>. I'm a Software Engineer with a keen interest in Cybersecurity and am completing a degree in Computer Science. Through time, I've been hands-on building secure and sharpened applications and gradually layered on challenges aimed at keeping systems safe from ever-evolving threats.

I stand at the intersection of software engineering and cybersecurity and strive to develop solutions that are creative and efficient yet robust and secure. I enjoy involvement in anything that calls for combining technical skill together with security-mindedness—whatever that might be from refining code, strengthening security, or just getting ahead of the latest vulnerability.

My journey with technology began in elementary school, when I developed a great interest in cybersecurity. Since then, I have been studying and developing in this area. It was in college that I fell in love with programming, and in a short time, I had already learned several languages ​​and frameworks.

This blog is a window into my work, perspectives, and learning from the internet world. For any of my fellow developers, security fans, or the merely curious playing with a gadget, I really do hope there's something in here that you'll find useful!
